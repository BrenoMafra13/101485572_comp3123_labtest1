# To run:
- Step 1: npm init -y
- Step 2: npm install

# About question 1:
You can run the file question1.js to see the output.

# About question 2:
The callback.js is just a copy of the code given in the exercise, please run question2.js to see the question answer (output).

# About question 3:
To run question 3, go to index.js because this file calls the other two ones (create.js and remove.js)
If you need to see the Logs folder created, is needed that you invert the order of calling functions in index.js because the way I let it was creating and deleting right after.
